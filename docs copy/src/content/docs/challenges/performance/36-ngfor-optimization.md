## Information

In this application, we have a list of individuals that we can add, delete or update. If you open the developer Chrome panel by pressing **F12**, go to the <b>Elements</b> tab, and expand the element to see the list, you will notice that each time you add, delete or update a list item, all the DOM elements are destroyed and initialized again. (See video below).

We can also use the <b>Angular DevTool</b> to profile our application and understand what is happening inside our application. I will show you how to do it inside the following video.

If you need more information about `NgFor`, I invite you to read the [documentation](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgFor) first.

## Statement

The goal of this challenge is to understand what is causing this DOM refresh and to solve it.
