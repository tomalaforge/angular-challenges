## Information

We have a legacy application that is using observables to store a state. Signals are a very good fit for that.

## Statement

So, the goal of this challenge is to refactor the following application to be a fully signal-based application. When you are done, neither the pipe nor the service should import RxJS.

Be careful along the way; everything might not work as you wish.
