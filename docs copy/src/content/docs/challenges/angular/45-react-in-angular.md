The goal of this challenge is to use a React component inside an Angular application.

Many components are available in React, and it can be interesting to use them in an Angular application. The goal is to create a React component and use it in an Angular application.

## Information

In this challenge, we have a simple application and a React component `ReactPost` in `app/react` to illustrate a React component from a library.

## Statement

- Your task is to display the posts with the React component `ReactPost`.
- When you select a post, the post should be highlighted.

In order to play with the React component, you should start by installing the React dependencies.

```bash
npm i --save react react-dom
npm i --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Constraints

- Do not transform the React component into an Angular component. The React component is pretty simple and can be written with ease in Angular. But **the goal is to use the React component**.

### Hint

  Allow the React files in tsconfig.json

```
{
...
"compilerOptions": {
  ...
  "jsx": "react"
},

}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2 - Initialization</summary>

    <react root>.render(
        <React.StrictMode>
        ...
        </React.StrictMode>
    )
    ```
