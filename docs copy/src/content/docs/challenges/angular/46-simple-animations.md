## Information

This is the first of two animation challenges. The goal of this series is to master animations in Angular.

Well-designed animations can make your application more fun and straightforward to use, but they aren't just cosmetic. Animations can improve your application and user experience in a number of ways:

- Without animations, web page transitions can seem abrupt and jarring.
- Motion greatly enhances the user experience, so animations give users a chance to detect the application's response to their actions.
- Good animations intuitively call the user's attention to where it is needed.

I would recommend you read the [official documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/animations). You will learn everything that is necessary to successfully complete the challenge.

Otherwise, look at this [working example](https://svenson95.github.io/ng-xmp-animations/) and [git repo](https://github.com/svenson95/ng-xmp-animations) to get inspired.

## Statement

The goal of this challenge is to add animations, they should run when the user arrives on the page or reload the page.

## Constraints

- Don't use any CSS and utilize Angular's integrated `@angular/animations` API.
- Don't trigger the animations with a button like in the examples, rather when the user enter or reload the page.
