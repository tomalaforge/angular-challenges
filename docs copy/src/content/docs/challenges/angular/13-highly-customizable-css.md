## Information

Styling is an important aspect of a frontend developer's day job, but it is often underestimated. In Angular applications, I frequently see people using `@Input()` to customize the style of their components. However, `@Input()` should only be used for logic. Other techniques, such as **CSS variables** and **host-context**, should be used for styling.

In this challenge, you will need to use both CSS variables and `:host-context` to remove all `@Input()` from your code.

## Constraints

- In your final submission, your component should not contain any lines of code. All styling should be handled within the decorator _(or external css files if you prefer)_
