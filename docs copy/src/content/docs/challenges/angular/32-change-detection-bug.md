:::note
This challenge is inspired by a real-life example that I simplified to create this nice challenge.
:::

## Information

In this small application, we have a navigation menu to route our application to either `BarComponent` or `FooComponent`. However, our application is not loading and no errors are displayed inside the console.

## Statement

The goal of the challenge is to debug this application and make it work.

:::note
Without knowing the exact reason for the issue, you can "fix" the error and get the program to function. One such approach would be to memoize `getMenu`. The application might work again, but make sure you really understand the problem and its consequences. Making it work isn't always enough; fixing this bug in the wrong way can cause a loss of performance or lead to other problems later on.

## Hints

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  If you comment out `routerLinkActive="isSelected"` inside `NavigationComponent`, the application loads correctly.

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>

If you open the [`RouterLinkActive` source code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/directives/router_link_active.ts) and go to **line 196**, Angular is calling `this.cdr.markForCheck` inside a microTask, which triggers a new CD cycle. If you comment out this line, the application loads again, however, the bug should not be fixed by changing the Angular source code. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¯
