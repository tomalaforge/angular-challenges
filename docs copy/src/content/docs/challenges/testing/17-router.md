## Information

We have a functional application that lists available books for borrowing inside a library. If the book you searched for is available, you will be directed to the corresponding book(s), otherwise, you will end up on an error page.

The file named `app.component.spec.ts` will let you test your application using [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) . To run the test suites, you need to run `npx nx test testing-router-outlet`. You can also install [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) to execute your test by clicking on the `Run` button above each `describe` or `it` blocks.

For testing with Cypress, you will execute your test inside the `app.component.cy.ts` and run `npx nx component-test testing-router-outlet` to execute your test suites. You can add the `--watch` flag to execute your test in watch mode.

# Statement

The goal is to test multiple behaviors of the application described in each test file using [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview).

:::note
I have created some `it` blocks but feel free to add more tests if you want.
