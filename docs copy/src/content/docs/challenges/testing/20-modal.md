## Information

In this small application, you have an input prompting you to enter a name, and a **Confirm** button to submit your form.
If you enter a name, a confirmation modal will appear; otherwise an error modal will be displayed.
In the confirmation modal, if you click the **Confirm** button, a message confirming the submission of the form will appear. If the user clicks on **Cancel**, an error message will be displayed.

The goal of this challenge is to test the dialogs inside your application. To do so, we will test the full application like an end-to-end test will do. This means, we will test the `AppComponent` as a black box and react to events on the page. <b>No internal details should be tested</b>. The difference between an e2e test and integration test is that we will mock all API calls. _(All http requests are faked inside this application, but this would not be the case in a real enterprise application.)_

You can play with it by running : `npx nx serve testing-modal`.

The file named `app.component.spec.ts` will let you test your application using [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) . To run the test suites, you need to run `npx nx test testing-modal`. You can also install [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) to execute your test by clicking on the `Run` button above each `describe` or `it` blocks.

For testing with Cypress, you will execute your test inside `app.component.cy.ts` and run `npx nx component-test testing-modal` to execute your test suites. You can add the `--watch` flag to execute your test in watch mode.

# Statement

The goal is to test multiple behaviors of the application described inside each test file using [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Cypress Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview).

:::note
I have created some `it` blocks but feel free to add more tests if you want.
