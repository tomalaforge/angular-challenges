<h1>RxJs race condition</h1>

> Author: Thomas Laforge

### Information

The goal of this application is to display a list of topics in a modal when a button is clicked. The application functions correctly. However, your tech lead has asked you to add tests and they are failing.

### Statement

Correct your application to pass the test

### Constraints:

- I can see you coming 🤣 => You CANNOT change the test (Test is working fine) 😳
- You CANNOT change the `fakeGetHttpTopic` method. A delay has been added to fake a slow network.

### Run the test

HEADLESS : `npx nx component-test rxjs-race-condition`
WATCH MODE : `npx nx component-test rxjs-race-condition --watch`

### Submitting your work

1. Fork the project
2. clone it
3. npm install
4. `npx nx serve rxjs-race-condition`
5. _...work on it_
6. Commit your work
7. Submit a PR with a title beginning with **Answer:14** that I will review and other dev can review.
