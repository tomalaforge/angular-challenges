## Open the project in your favourite IDE

Open the project in any IDE of your choice.

## Install all dependencies

## Choose a challenge

Your project is now up and running. The only remaining step is to choose a challenge 🚀

Each challenge consists of:

- <b>Name</b>: indicating what the challenge is about.
- <b>Number</b>: order of creation. The number doesn't have any particular meaning but helps for reference in Github Pull Request section.
- <b>Badge</b>: helps visualize the degree of difficulty. It's entirely subjective 😅
  - 🟢 easy
  - 🟠 medium
  - 🔴 difficult
